# IMPORTANT
- [x] BenchCT uses the OverlapStructure module from ChimCT.
      It should be transfered to the "core" in order to simplify the
      installation of benchCT!!! Finally it has been directly included in benchCT
      in a more lightweight fashion.

# Libraries
- [ ] Verify that All data in CracTools::BenchCT::Checker are 0 based
- [ ] Verify that analyzers are aware of the 0-based specificity of the checker
- [ ] Create a library that contains all checked events:
      - mapping
      - error
      - snp
      - insertion
      - deletion

# REFONT
- [x] isGoodAlignemnt and isTrueError should be implemented as CracTools::Events doughter class
- [x] Add transcript assessment support
- Create daughter classes for CracTools::BenchCT::Stats object to provide more complete
  statistics according to specific events
- [x] Create a daughter class for CracTools::Events classes that are based on IntervalTree
  like exons, splice
- [ ] Find a way to standardized event checking, to avoid giving special method name for each event checker
- [ ] Add an option to only check a sample of element (specially for mapping) to reduce
  benchmark time
- [ ] Find a way to merge parser that are common between the Checker and some Analyzers
- [ ] Refont the way we handles threshold for event checking
      - we should be able to change the values for a specific file checking
      - we should also be able to add new threshold parameters
- [ ] Propose new checking parameters for transcript coverage
- [ ] Try to integrate Moose

# Binary
- [ ] generates multiple statistics ouput
      - 1 for each software
      - 1 for each cause
- [x] benchCT could be parrallelized, on the file reading/parsing
- [ ] use threads instead of forks (less memory consuming)
- [x] The output format should be changed to have the following columns (Software, Event, Statistic_type, value)

# BUGS
- [x] There is a problem with CRAC insertions there are 1-based instead of 0-based
      Actually there is more problems with CRAC,
