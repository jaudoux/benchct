# Libraries
- Verify that All data in CracTools::BenchCT::Checker are 0 based
- Verify that analyzers are aware of the 0-based specificity of the checker
- Create a library that contains all checked events:
  - mapping
  - error
  - snp
  - insertion
  - deletion

# REFONT
- isGoodAlignemnt and isTrueError should be implemented as CracTools::Events doughter class
- [DONE] Add transcript assessment support
- Create daughter classes for CracTools::BenchCT::Stats object to provide more complete
  statistics according to specific events
- Add an option to only check a sample of element (specially for mapping) to reduce
  benchmark time

# Binary
- generates multiple statistics ouput
  - 1 for each software
  - 1 for each cause
- [DONE] benchCT could be parrallelized, on the file reading/parsing
- use threads instead of forks (less memory consuming)
- [DONE] The output format should be changed to have the following columns (Software, Event, Statistic_type, value)

# BUGS
- There is a problem with CRAC insertions there are 1-based instead of 0-based
