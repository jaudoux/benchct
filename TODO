# Libraries
- Verify that All data in CracTools::BenchCT::Checker are 0 based
- Verify that analyzers are aware of the 0-based specificity of the checker
- Create a library that contains all checked events:
  - mapping
  - error
  - snp
  - insertion
  - deletion

# Binary
- generates multiple statistics ouput
  - 1 for each software
  - 1 for each cause
- benchCT could be parrallelized, on the file reading/parsing

# BUGS
- There is a problem with CRAC insertions there are 1-based instead of 0-based
